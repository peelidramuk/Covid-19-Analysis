COVID-19 Data Analysis
This project analyzes COVID-19 case data over time using Python. The project reads, processes, and visualizes COVID-19 data, showing trends in confirmed, recovered, and death cases by country. This project uses libraries like pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib for visualization, numpy for numerical operations, and sklearn for handling missing data.

Project Structure:
Data Loading: Reads a CSV file containing COVID-19 data.
Data Cleaning: Drops unnecessary columns, renames columns for consistency, and handles missing data with imputation.
Data Processing: Groups data by date and country to prepare for analysis.
Data Visualization: Plots the number of confirmed, recovered, and death cases over time for each country.
